# eCommerce data analysis and visualization with Power BI

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and visualization using Power BI. The dataset is about an eCommerce platform with multiple sales channels, products, and demographic details. It includes information on sales across various cities and states, segmented by different age groups and gender.

The project demonstrates how to extract meaningful insights and trends from the dataset through interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboards.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following key attributes:
- **Product Information**: Includes details such as product categories, SKUs, and product names.
- **Sales Data**: Records of transactions, including the number of units sold, revenue, and discount applied.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age groups and gender of customers.
- **Geographical Data**: Sales information based on cities and states.
- **Channels**: Different sales channels like online, in-store, and other platforms.

### Dataset Columns:
- `Product ID`
- `Product Category`
- `Product Name`
- `Units Sold`
- `Revenue`
- `Discount Applied`
- `Age Group`
- `Gender`
- `City`
- `State`
- `Sales Channel`

## Power BI Visualizations
The following types of visualizations were created in Power BI:
1. **Sales Performance by Product**: A bar chart showing the total sales (units sold and revenue) for each product.
2. **Sales by Channel**: A pie chart depicting the proportion of sales from each channel (online, in-store, etc.).
3. **Demographic Insights**: A dashboard with interactive slicers to filter sales data by age group and gender.
4. **Geographical Analysis**: Maps to visualize sales across different cities and states.
5. **Time-based Analysis**: Line graphs showing sales trends over time, segmented by various factors like age group, gender, and product.

## Features
- Interactive filters and slicers for exploring different segments (age group, gender, product category, etc.).
- Drill-through functionality to explore detailed data for specific products or customers.
- Visual representation of sales performance across various channels and locations.
- Insights on which products perform better based on different customer demographics.
